# Contact Support Modal Implementation

## Overview

Successfully replaced the email copying functionality with a modern popup form that allows users to send support requests directly to `support@papermark.io`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Template (`components/emails/contact-support.tsx`)
- Professional email template for support requests
- Includes user information (name, email), subject, and message
- Uses the existing Papermark email design system
- Formatted for easy reading by support team

### 2. API Endpoint (`pages/api/support/contact.ts`)
- **Route**: `POST /api/support/contact`
- **Authentication**: Requires valid user session
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 requests per hour per user
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for subject and message
- **Email Sending**: Uses existing Resend infrastructure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Contact Support Modal (`components/contact-support-modal.tsx`)
- Modern popup modal following existing design patterns
- Form fields for subject and message
- Real-time validation and character counting (2000 char limit)
- Loading states and proper error handling
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)

### 4. Component Updates

#### `components/sidebar/nav-user.tsx`
- **Before**: Copied `support@papermark.io` to clipboard with toast message
- **After**: Opens contact support modal when "Contact Support" is clicked

#### `components/profile-menu.tsx`
- **Before**: `mailto:support@papermark.io` link that opened external email client
- **After**: Opens contact support modal when "Contact us" is clicked

## Features

✅ **Instant Support**: Users can send support requests without leaving the app
✅ **User Context**: Automatically includes user name and email
✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam with 5 requests/hour limit
✅ **Validation**: Proper form validation with helpful error messages
✅ **Professional Email**: Support team receives well-formatted emails

✅ **Consistent UI**: Follows existing Papermark design patterns

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Radix UI components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Zod validation
- **Email**: Resend service with React Email templates
- **Authentication**: NextAuth session verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting utility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with existing design system

## Security & Performance

- Session-based authentication prevents unauthorized submissions
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Uses existing infrastructure (no new dependencies)

## User Experience

2. Modal opens with form fields
3. User fills subject and message
4. Real-time validation and character count
5. Submit button sends request
6. Success toast confirms submission
